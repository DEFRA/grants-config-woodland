## Grant Configuration

### Create new

Each directory within the `configurations` folder represents a separate grant.

To create a new grant:

1. Create a new directory under `configurations`, for example:

   ```text
   configurations/playground
   ```

2. Add at least one configuration file, for example:

   ```text
   configurations/playground/slide-config/main.json
   ```

3. Create a new version:

   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```

4. Stage and commit your changes using the standard commit format:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(YOUR-TICKET): YOUR-MESSAGE"
   ```

5. Push your branch and then follow the standard GitHub pull request process.

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Update existing

To update the configuration for an existing grant:

1. Add or modify the required configuration files.

2. Create a new version:

   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```

3. Stage and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(YOUR-TICKET): YOUR-MESSAGE"
   ```

4. Push your branch and then follow the standard GitHub pull request process.

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Non-configuration changes

Any change that does not modify the contents of the `configurations` directory is considered a **non-configuration change**.

Do **not** create a changeset for these changes. Non-configuration changes do not trigger service publication when merged into `main`.

### Hotfix releases

Hotfix releases should only be used as a last resort when a fix cannot be delivered through the normal release process because subsequent releases contain incompatible changes.

> **Important:** Changes made on a hotfix branch are not automatically included in future releases. After publishing the hotfix, apply the same changes to `main` to ensure they are included in the next release.

Hotfix releases can only increment the **patch** version of an existing release.

If a hotfix is required, complete the following steps:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the tagged release version that requires the fix. For example, the following command creates a `hotfix-releases/6.3.x` branch from the `6.3.0` tag:

   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   git switch -c hotfix-releases/6.3.x tags/6.3.0
   ```

2. Make the required configuration changes.

3. Create a new patch version:

   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```

4. Stage, commit, and push your changes.

5. Manually run the **Publish Hot Fix** GitHub workflow.

   **Note:** This workflow only runs on branches with the `hotfix-releases/` prefix.

   The workflow will:
   - Publish the new patch version.
   - Remove the generated changeset file.

   The workflow requires a `description` input, which is used as part of the workflow run name.

## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v24` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd grants-config-woodland
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Git hooks

Install git hooks (optional)

```bash
npm run git:hooks
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## API endpoints

| Endpoint       | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| `GET: /health` | Health      |

## Development helpers

### Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Docker

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag grants-config-woodland .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 grants-config-woodland
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Floci for AWS services (S3, SQS, SNS etc)
- Redis
- This service.
- A commented out frontend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Mock AWS resources can be created when Floci starts up by editing the scripts in `./compose/floci/start.d/`.

### Dependabot

Dependabot is enabled in this repository.

### SonarCloud
